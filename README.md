# InsightIQ

InsightIQ is a personal project I've undertaken to explore the fascinating world of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective of this project is to develop a practical and valuable tool that not only assists me but also benefits others. It aims to create an intelligent knowledge management system that serves as a personal assistant.

Key Tenets of the Project:

1. **Privacy-First Architecture**: Implement robust security measures and adhere to best practices in data handling
and storage to prioritize user data privacy and security.
2. **Secure and Convenient Personal Storage**: Provide a secure storage solution for personal data, whether locally or in the cloud, ensuring ease of use and data protection.
3. **LLM Agnostic Approach**: Build a plugin architecture that supports various LLMs, enabling seamless integration with different models (e.g., ChatGPT or similar LLMs) without sacrificing functionality.
4. **Extensibility**: Allow the integration of personal data from diverse sources such as emails, calendar events, and documents, empowering users to expand and enhance the system's knowledge base.

These tenets guide the development of InsightIQ, ensuring a privacy-centric approach, a secure and intuitive user
experience, flexibility with LLMs, and the ability to incorporate personal data from multiple sources to enrich the
knowledge management capabilities
